# Parliament Visualization
This is a repository for web visualization project about ukrainian parliamen convocations.
The project will be made using D3 library.
## Idea
I'd like to make a remake on Andriy Gasin's visualizations. [Here is the link](https://github.com/andriy-gazin/mps)
The idea is not to invent a bicycle, but to take some good ideas, add time, and make those static visualizations move in a pretty way :)
## Project stages
1) Data exploration and preprocessing using JavaScript
2) Find out options how to make data interactive in the best way
3) Getting started with d3.js (DOM manipulations, scales, D3 layouts...)
4) Make a static visualization
5) Make visualisation interactive
6) Make the project look more appealing
