# Election_Visualization
This is a repository for web visualization project about ukrainian elections.
The project will be made using d3.js library and JavaScript only.
## Idea
I'd like to make a remake on Andriy Gasin's visualizations. [Here is the link](https://github.com/andriy-gazin/mps)
The idea is not to invent a bicycle, but to take some good ideas add time and make those static visualizations move :)
## Project stages
1) Data exploration and preprocessing using JavaScript
2) Find out options how to make data interactive in the best way
3) Getting started with d3.js (DOM manipulations, scales, D3 layouts...)
4) Make a static visualization
5) Make visualisation interactive
6) Make the project look more appealing 
##Get things done
Till 25.08 I plan to end up at the fourth stage (static visualisation)
